Show My Love

A button has an attribute called onclick which you can put JavaScript in. Let's say you have a function called sayHello declared in your script file. You can do this:

<button onclick="sayHello();">Say Hello</button>

Now every time a user clicks that button on your page, it will call your function.

In this project you will need HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You are going to make a web page that:

1. Has the header "Declare my love"
2. Has a button called "Show me the love"
3. Above the button, insert the heart image. See attached file.
4. When clicked, the button should run a function you create that alerts a different message based on user input.
5. Ask the user what their name is.
6. Ask the user what their favorite color is.
7. Pick 3 of your favorite colors, if the user types in one of your favorite colors, alert them with a positive message.
8. If the user inputs a different color, then tell them you aren't compatible.
9. Style the page (with CSS) so it looks like a valentine. You can add any amount of HTML/CSS you want to accomplish this. Please do not spend more than 15 minutes on the HTML/CSS (unless you want to at home).

Tips: 

* Use pseudocode to help you with creating a blueprint of the app before you start writing JavaScript. 
* Store the different prompts into variables. 
* Think about when you should use let or const.
* Use descriptive variable names.
